                        <h1> Pros of Having Trees and Plants</h1>
                        <p>Many people tend to believe that there can only be good coming from planting trees and flowering plants throughout the city.  To a degree, that is true.  However, it's something that also brings some unforeseen issues that make things difficult for many that work and/or reside within the city.</p>
                        <p>There will always be advantages and disadvantages to having trees in urban areas.  I will mention a few of each here.</p><br>

                        <h3>Decreases pollution and aids in energy conservation.</h3>                   
                        <h4>Trees conserve energy</h4>
                        <p>Three trees placed strategically around a single-family home can cut summer air conditioning needs by up to 50 percent. By reducing the energy demand for cooling our houses, we reduce carbon dioxide and other pollution emissions from power plants.</p>              

                        <h3>Better air quality.</h3>
                        <h4>Trees clean the air</h4>
                        <p>Trees absorb odors and pollutant gases (nitrogen oxides, ammonia, sulfur dioxide and ozone) and filter particulates out of the air by trapping them on their leaves and bark.</p>                   

                        <p>There are many other positives of having trees in urban environments, and the link below will show many more of them.</p>
